This tutorial is about GitHub and the command line! I struggled with this so I am going to try to explain it so we can all hopefully understand!
In git there a some commands that you will need to learn:
<li> cd </li>
<li>git push</li>
<li>git pull</li>
<li>git add</li>
<li>git commit</li>
*CD command*
The Cd command is the command you use to change directories. To get yourself in the spot so you can start your project.


**Git Push**
The git push command is to adding a file to a repository on GitHub! So after you make changes you would use this command to push it to the internet.


**Git Pull**
The git pull command performs a merge on retrieved changes!


**Git Add**
This command updates the index using the current content found in the working tree


**Git Commit**
This command stores the current contents of the index in a new commit along with a log message from the user describing the changes.
