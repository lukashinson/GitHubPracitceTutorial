This tutorial is about GitHub and the command line! I struggled with this so I am going to try to explain it so we can all hopefully understand! My target audience is any age, but its for people who don't quite understand the command line or GitHub!
In git there a some commands that you will need to learn:
<li> cd </li>
<li>git push</li>
<li>git pull</li>
<li>git add</li>
<li>git commit</li>


**CD command**
The Cd command is the command you use to change directories. To get yourself in the spot so you can start your project.



**Git Push**
The git push command is to adding a file to a repository on GitHub! So after you make changes you would use this command to push it to the internet.


**Git Pull**
The git pull command performs a merge on retrieved changes!


**Git Add**
This command updates the index using the current content found in the working tree


**Git Commit**
This command stores the current contents of the index in a new commit along with a log message from the user describing the changes.
